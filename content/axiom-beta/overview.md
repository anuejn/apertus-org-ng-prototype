 <h2 style="color: black;">Introducing the AXIOM Beta</h2>
 <p>The first of its kind, and providing users with the ability to swap or upgrade sensors at any time, our community’s
  debut camera is the result of years of collaboration with the <a href="https://www.magiclantern.fm/" target="blank">Magic
   Lantern</a> team. With powerful internal components, custom-built printed circuit boards and plugin modules,
  FPGAs and an onboard Linux operating system at your disposal, changing the entire operation of your camera to suit
  the needs of any project is now possible.</p>

 <h3>AXIOM Beta Compact enclosure concept circa Nov 2017</h3>
 <h2>Built for Professionals</h2>
 <p>The camera boasts superb image quality, high frame rates, rich colour science properties and a small, lightweight
  form factor. It's designed to evolve continuously and give users unparalleled access to the raw data being recorded
  from a sensor. Individual hardware components can be swapped out and upgraded as and when required, and software
  can be modified to suit the needs of specific use cases anytime. Take what we’ve done, modify anything you like in
  whatever way you like, and make it yours.</p>

 <p class="quote">We need
  a camera that is fully customisable. I can build my PC and pick every single part to fit my needs and upgrade
  each part as and when needed. It would be great to just upgrade the AF system or upgrade to a new sensor
  instead of buying a whole new camera.<b>Adam Cross</b></p>

 <p class="quote" style="left: -50px;">The
  most interesting aspect of the AXIOM cameras is that they have the potential to be the last camera you will
  ever need… they won't eventually become technologically obsolete like most cameras.<b><a href="https://nofilmschool.com/" target="_blank">No Film

  <h3>AXIOM Beta Developer Kit</h3>
  <p>
   This version of the camera is suitable for anyone who’d like to work on development, reconfigure its
   software and or core components, or build their own enclosures etc… Developer Kits are supported by a
   custom CNC-milled skeleton framework and provide easy access to the camera’s printed circuit boards - With
   this in mind associated design files, board layouts, BOMs, CAD models, software source code repositories,
   etc. are all made freely available.
  </p>

  <h3>AXIOM Beta Compact</h3>
  <p>
   This enclosure option provides a solid but lightweight aluminum layer around the camera's electronics and
   incorporates several mount points and future expansion slots. Individual modules are swappable (eg. lens
   mount, plugin modules) and extra care has been taken to use screws instead of glue so that customisation,
   and, should the need arise, simple repairs are made easy.
  </p>
  <p>
   AXIOM Beta Compact is purpose-built for rig integration and general in-the-field protection, making it
   ideally suited to most photo and video production environments.

  <h3>AXIOM Beta Extended</h3>
  <p>
   Currently in a state of early development, and inspired by the 35mm film camera magazines of yesteryear's
   golden
   age of analog film cameras, this enclosure is ideal for any film production scenario and rests well on the
   DOP's
   shoulders.
   With ergonomics in mind and providing space for a more sophisticated airflow system, AXIOM Beta Extended is a
   camera and integrated AXIOM Recorder combination that plans to incorporate an INTEL NUC and 2.5" SSD(s). And of
   course, the AXIOM Recorder module can be attached in various locations around the enclosure and at different
   angles.Learn more about the AXIOM Beta Extended from <a href="https://www.apertus.org/axiom-team-talk-volume-13.2-article-november-2017" target="blank">Team Talk 13.2</a>.
