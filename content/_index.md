## The first camera where truely nothing is hidden from you.

Backed by a Crowdfunding Campaign, the [AXIOM Beta](/axiom-beta) is the first fully open Source Cinema Camera. It allows you to control every
aspect of the Image capture from the very beginning. With high quality replaceable image sensors and modular electronics, AXIOM Beta is highly
customizable and can adapt to any application. Being upgradeable to the core, it wont become obsolete and improve over time.

<h2 style="max-width: 50vw;">Community-Driven</h2>

Our worldwide community is developing a
variety of powerful and affordable tools designed to give users absolute
control over their creative processes. All projects are free (in terms
of liberty) and revolve around open source software and open hardware
licenses with any and all related knowledge being made publicly
available. To find out more about our goals and methods please read the [Mission Statement](/mission-statement)

## For Film-Makers By Film-Makers
For decades film-makers have been suffering from the tight grip big camera manufacturing
corporations had on them. It's time we unite forces and take matters into our own hands. By
sharing everything we create for free and as Open Source we are setting a radical example
how things can be done differently.

        The AXIOM Beta Developer Kit (ABDK) is suitable for anyone who’d like to work on
        development, reconfigure its software and or core components, or build your own enclosures
        or hardware ad-dons, etc… Developer Kits are supported by a custom CNC-milled skeleton
        framework and provide easy access to the camera’s printed circuit boards - With this in mind
        associated design files, board layouts, BOMs, CAD models, software source code repositories,
        etc. are all freely available.
        For insight into how AXIOM Beta Developer Kits have been configured by members of the

    <p>
        The responsibility to exercise total freedom by creating better
        tools lies with all of us as individuals. Our association and its wider
        community has been established so that taking this responsibility on,
        and thereby rising above the corporations who’ve put limitations on our
        ability to create freely, is made easier for everyone. The AXIOM project
        is more than good hardware devices and software applications, it's a
        library of knowledge that anyone is free to contribute towards building.
